# Vector Race Track

This is a simulation of a scenario representative of a very basic 'race track' in which a vehicle
moves along some path. The limitations are:
 * Vehicle may start at any velocity
 * Vehicle may accelerate +/- 1 in each axis
 * Vehicle must stay within boundaries; it cannot touch them

This simulation of the scenario attempts to find the optimal paths through (currently) a brute-force
search of the problem space. The problem description and general layout of the track are taken from
the *Linear Algebra, A Modern Introduction*, 4th edition, by David Poole.
